# ICA2-Supplementary-Materials
Benchmark on auto-annotation tools for single cell sequencing data 

### Code usage:
- For single dataset running, use pipelines/scripts/{tool}.R or {tool}.py

- For multi dataset running, use pipelins/batch_{tool}.R or batch_{tool}.py

- To get data for 5-fold cross-validation, use pipelines/cross_validation.R

- For within and cross-sample metric calculation, refer pipelines/visual.ipynb and pipelines/stats_across.ipynb, respectively.

### Results:
- Tools, data and within-sample benchmark:
